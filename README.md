First started with creating basic colour gradient image. Then created a sphere of solid colour. Then added a ground to the background by creating a large sphere. Next target 
was to create a colour on the surface of sphere according to the normal. Then created a sphere of lambertian material, implemented gamma correction on it.
Then created a metal sphere, added buzz effect on it. Also created a Sphere of dielectric material, added Total Internal Reflection and Refraction element to it.
Finally, created a basic ray tracing engine that creates a randomly placed spheres of materials such as lambertian, dielectric and metal.
