First started with creating basic colour gradient image. Then created a sphere of solid colour. Then added a ground to the background by creating a large sphere. Next target 
was to create a colour on the surface of sphere according to the normal. Then created a sphere of lambertian material, implemented gamma correction on it.
Then created a metal sphere, added buzz effect on it. Also created a Sphere of dielectric material, added Total Internal Reflection and Refraction element to it.
Finally, created a basic ray tracing engine that creates a randomly placed spheres of materials such as lambertian, dielectric and metal. Then we implemented Bounding Volume Hierarchy for faster rendering. We added functions to implement perlin noise, textures. Then we worked with Rectangles shapes, lights and cornell box. Then we developed Probability Density Functions to reduce the noise in the images.
